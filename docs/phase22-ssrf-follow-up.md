# Replacement SSRF follow-up

The user authorized a bounded offline investigation and fix after the completed
technical audit. The five open-webSearch replacements are exposed regression
cases from that decision forward. The original manifest, first measurements,
labels, source archives and paid ledgers remain unchanged. The separate decision
is `artifacts/phase22/corpus-replacement-v1/exposure-and-fix-authorization.json`.

## Registration correction

The shared TypeScript flow followed factory-created `registerTool` callbacks but
ignored legacy `.tool(...)` registrations. Both discovery and rule interpretation
now route the supported schema-bearing legacy forms through the existing
registration path. Captured helpers and caller arguments reach the request sink;
a helper that fetches a fixed public destination remains a negative control.
Computed names remain unresolved. The existing Zod reader distinguishes supported
schemas from annotation objects and unknown metadata; unsupported overloads are
reported as unresolved rather than interpreting their callback context as tool
arguments.

The regression reproduced eight missing legacy registrations while four
`registerTool` controls passed. The correction also covers six unsupported-layout
controls. Focused discovery, SSRF and containment checks pass 353 tests. The
legacy-registration checkpoint `4f46dc6` passes the full suite: 2,042 tests, 36
skips and 89.50% branch coverage. Its raw coverage and source patch are retained;
that checkpoint does not establish a pass for subsequent method changes.

The follow-up trace also found that object-literal methods were discarded and
separate returned functions could overwrite captured fetchers. The shared flow
now retains ordinary/async methods and arrow properties, separates captures by
source call context, and preserves ordinary versus lexical `this` for dot and
literal-key calls. Replacement, borrowing, extraction and escape controls remain
covered; accessors stay explicitly unresolved. The shared regression selection
passes 933 tests. Final source-bound benchmark and hosted checks are recorded
separately in the integration evidence.

## Remaining measured boundary

The initial exposed-case diagnostic still produces no SENT-015 candidate for the
named IPv4-mapped loopback condition. It reaches the MCP callbacks and reports
`runtime.services.fetchWeb.execute` as unresolved. With an evaluator-supplied
source runtime, the method correction resolves `execute` and reaches the next
unresolved boundary, the optional default `fetcher`. The source registration factory
receives an injected runtime argument; the actual startup selects that dependency
through a local dynamic import, conditional initialization and optional dependency
factories. Recognizing a registration alone does not bind that service.

A complete follow-up must establish that source chain and preserve the distinction
between the vulnerable URL/IP predicate and the fixed bracket normalization,
address classification and request filtering. A helper's name is not a defense;
broadly flagging both revisions would not demonstrate the required distinction.
Any evaluator-assisted source trace is diagnostic evidence, not a native benchmark
hit or runtime confirmation. No upstream target is executed on the host.

More paid review is not a remedy for this missing candidate: the current review
stage is candidate-bound. The 396 deferred requests and external pilots remain
nonblocking under the user's revised completion scope, without being counted as
passed. Final technical acceptance and disposition of the residual limitation
remain with the user; Phase 22 is not marked complete by this correction.

## Exposed-case remeasurement and fresh proposal

All five original replacements complete twice on `68bdf83`; stable reports and
outcomes match. Both vulnerable variants remain misses, and no fixed/safe case
has a matching SSRF alert. All 70 authentication findings equal the first
measurement after excluding run identities and clocks. Their retained source
assessments remain applicable. The unchanged comparator's original 33 warnings
are reused as separately identified evidence; no new comparator run is claimed.

Each report has 13 recognized HTTP surfaces, one unresolved HTTP surface and
26 unresolved tool registration contexts. Following more factory/test contexts
increases diagnostic records; it does not mean 26 distinct tools were discovered.
The six underlying computed-name SDK callbacks remain unresolved. In the original
Mastra development cases, object-method support replaces unresolved logger calls
with the remaining unresolved operations inside those methods. Findings and
recognized surface counts are unchanged; diagnostic movement is not a detection
gain or evidence of protection.

Because the exposed cases informed these fixes, the original handoff requires a
replacement through the freeze process. The new proposal is retained in
`artifacts/phase22/corpus-replacement-v2/`, with five fetch-mcp cases, complete
MIT-licensed source archives, reversible helper-name mutations and a public IPv4
classification control. Its exact manifest is
`a587427f0c40cbff512f00c8024e454a11255e34a13c10f9d8748bbc4aa9bae2`.
The detector froze at `68bdf83` before advisory/source curation. No scanner,
comparator, upstream test or target execution has run on these cases. Explicit
freeze approval is required for the proposed offline evaluation; it includes no
paid calls. The narrow source-backed labels do not claim complete SSRF protection.

## Verification and proposed disposition

All 29 hosted CI jobs pass at `68bdf83`: 12 full quality suites each report 2,057
passed, 36 skipped and 89.50–89.53% branch coverage. The complete CI/docs logs and
225 uploaded artifact files are retained. The canonical wheel and sdist contain
the exact current source, schema, fixture and approved capture bytes. Current
production capture replay accepts both original approved requests with no new
model calls; hosted Docker replay and network isolation pass.

The three historical batch attempts report 44/45, 45/45 and41/45 native
completions. Every input has at least two completed reports with recorded total
wall time at most 120 seconds; all completed reports match the prior stable content.
The complete pass retains 20 vulnerable condition hits and zero named fixed/safe
alerts. Five timeouts remain. One additional native-completed report has 123.8
seconds of total wall time and is excluded from the under 120-second count. These
per-input comparisons do not silently satisfy the original requirement for two
whole completed batches. Shared-host resource observations do not establish the
cause of the timing variance or an isolated-throughput claim.

The recommendation is to retain the bounded TypeScript corrections and accept
the residual service-binding limitation and measured timing variance for Phase 22,
using the explicitly reported per-input repeatability evidence. This is a
**proposal, not an approved gate change**; see
`artifacts/phase22/completion-scope-v1/follow-up-proposal.json`. The fresh five-case
manifest needs separate freeze approval before its offline evaluation. Paid review
remains deferred: the absent SSRF candidate gives candidate-bound review no new
condition to assess. Phase 22 remains incomplete pending the required decisions and
final technical acceptance.

The final original development measurement completes all 25 inputs with unchanged
findings: 10 vulnerable detections, the two preserved Meta fixed-label errata and
554 unmatched source-assessed findings. The original held-out run retains 10
completed/10 unsupported/5 incomplete inputs, with 0/4 completed vulnerable
variants detected. All canonical findings equal the prior measurements. The five
Mastra cases replace 80 unresolved logger-call diagnostics with 10 unresolved
operations inside those methods per input; their findings and recognized surface
counts are unchanged. Existing source assessments and pinned comparator results
are reused with exact identities, without claiming a new comparator execution.
