# Phase 22 constructor-scope correction checkpoint

The approved exposed Lighthouse regression **fails** at scanner **`6db3858`**,
workflow **`fc3a49a`**, run **34621524649**. The first vulnerable input completes
in **9.835 seconds** whole-input time (**2.071 seconds** native) but produces zero
findings and no matching sink candidate. Its JSON/SARIF and cleanup pass.
**One observation completed; nine unstarted observations are closed; zero budget
remains.** No fixed/control or ordered-repeat result exists. All 21 warnings and
six unresolved-flow occurrences are source-assessed. No retry or paid call occurred.

The constructor-scope correction is verified at scanner **`4a2359d`**.
Constructor eligibility now excludes returns owned by nested callbacks/functions/
classes; a constructor's own returned object remains unsupported. Five synthetic
counterexamples fail at `6db3858`; all 81 class/SDK tests and 315 affected tests
pass with the correction. No current-source corpus observation has occurred.

Full local and all 12 Linux/macOS/Windows × Python 3.10–3.13 suites pass
**2,236 tests / 36 skips**. Local branch coverage is **89.76%**; hosted
coverage is **89.75–89.78%**. All **29 normal jobs** and documentation
pass at workflow **`2998b79`**
([CI](https://github.com/BashaarJavaid/MCP-Sentinel/actions/runs/34622991759),
[docs](https://github.com/BashaarJavaid/MCP-Sentinel/actions/runs/34622991696)).
Wheel/sdist sources match actual Git blobs. Ruff/format/strict mypy, lock, schemas,
notices and offline artifacts pass. Six actual production requests regenerate
and checked-replay with unchanged fingerprints/request hashes and **zero paid calls**.
The owned Docker demo completes 20/20 attempts with 14 findings and cleanup.
Git's unchanged runtime/image retains 13 incomplete campaigns, 312/1,040 attempts.
The earlier 2,230-test pass remains bound to `6db3858`.

The new exact **unapproved** proposal is
`artifacts/phase22/integration/v27-constructor-fix/evaluation-proposal.json`
(SHA-256 `3ee50c9d652f1cd4d897348a1b77ecf2efb60d78c2b56beb163b286623f6fd8b`): the same five exposed inputs twice, ten native observations,
one standard Linux job capped at 60 minutes, 120-second target / 300-second
whole-input maximum, 15-second cleanup cap, zero retries/profiles/comparators/
target execution/paid calls. Stop on the first execution, condition or ordered-repeat
failure and close the unstarted remainder. The optional workflow remains disabled
in normal CI. No corpus observation has occurred at `4a2359d`.

The **89-row audit remains 82 passed, two user-deferred and five unresolved**.
The 72 added rows are 66 passed and six unresolved, including four closed historical
failure rows. No failed measurement is relabeled as accepted or reopened.
The original held-out baseline remains10 completed,10 unsupported and5 incomplete,
with0 hits among4 completed vulnerable inputs out of10 vulnerable inputs total.

Both the original fresh `1f3f72f` miss (15 completed, 0/2 vulnerable hits per batch)
and this later failed exposed regression remain preserved. The existing fix-it
instruction authorizes the root-cause source correction and ordinary engineering;
the measurement approval does not reopen a stopped budget. Earlier timing and
three exposed-family gates retain `1f3f72f` / `2ac39aa`; current-source compatibility,
fresh-result disposition and final human technical acceptance remain unresolved.
**Phase 22 is incomplete.** Paid benchmark/pilots remain deferred, Git campaigns
incomplete (312/1,040), Phase 21 incomplete and Phase 24/15 unchanged. No merge,
ready-state, release, outreach or Phase 23 work. v26/v27 identify evidence only.

The stopped run, all 27 diagnostic occurrences, synthetic failures, source correction, completed engineering and all prior immutable evidence are retained in seals 1–55. Final documentation/delivery bindings are supplemental. Phase 22 requires the remaining current-source gates and explicit human technical acceptance.
