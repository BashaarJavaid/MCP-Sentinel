# PortunusMCP Sentinel

## Current v35 exposed regression result and recovery checkpoint

The approved **87-observation exposed regression at `a50e9b7` is complete**,
but **the correction gate fails**. All 87 inputs complete within the uniform
300-second native/whole-input maximum; 79 meet the 120-second target and
8 use extended time. The longest whole input takes
**241.846285 seconds**. All **36 entire ordered repeats** agree
after the established volatile exclusions. JSON/SARIF, source/configuration
identity and process cleanup validate. All 87 observations are consumed and the
budget is closed: **zero retries, comparators, target executions or paid calls**.

DDG still detects both vulnerable variants in each batch. Its six fixed/control
reports now cover the actual HTTPX `client.send`, with `build_request`/`send`
unresolved diagnostics removed. However, **none carries the required initial
`100.64.0.0/10` rejection qualification**. Each fixed variant gains one generic
matching alert; the public control retains a broader unmatched candidate.
Supporting the request operation alone does not satisfy guard coverage.

Python compatibility also finds a regression: the two Meta image fixed variants
each gain **three unqualified alerts** on paths protected against the named
initial private/loopback/prohibited-scheme condition. Its public-literal control
retains three broader unmatched candidates. Development still detects all six
vulnerable conditions; five of seven valid negatives have no matching alert.
The two nominal fixed Meta operator erratum inputs retain their original two
matched keys each. No condition labels, prerequisites or raw reports changed.

Both 31-input Python historical batches retain **14 vulnerable hits and zero
matching alerts on 17 negatives** each. Every changed finding and diagnostic is
source-assessed; removed diagnostics do not establish full safety. Unchanged
TypeScript behavior retains source-compatible evidence at `f85a90f`. The original
whole development/historical Linux results remain measured at `1f3f72f`; these
partial compatibility checks are not a new pooled whole-batch timing pass.

Engineering retains its actual **`8a3db58`** verification: **2,280 passed / 36
skipped** locally and in all 12 hosted suites, **89.87%** local branch coverage,
all 29 normal CI jobs and docs, source-bound packages and six zero-call production
replays. Product, tests and workflows did not change during this evaluation.
No new hosted engineering pass is claimed for the documentation delivery.

The **first-frozen DDG fresh detection at `f85a90f` remains unchanged**, including
its fixed-path coverage limitation. This later correction is exposed regression.
Original fresh misses, held-out failures and every earlier closed attempt remain
preserved. Git campaigns stay **312/1,040 incomplete**, as requested. Paid
benchmark/pilots remain deferred; Phase 21 incomplete and Phase 24/15 unchanged.

The audit covers **89 original rows: 84 passed, two user-deferred, three
unresolved (R33, R65, R84)**, plus **97 added rows: 90 passed, five historical
proposed limitations and two unresolved**. The added DDG coverage/regression gates
remain unresolved. **Phase 22 is incomplete; technical acceptance is not requested.**
The prepared `v35-ddg-regression/recovery-proposal.json` requests source-only
reproduction/correction and ordinary engineering with **zero corpus observations
or paid calls**. It requires a new decision under the approved no-automatic-repair
clause; later exact evaluation and final human acceptance remain separate.
No merge, ready-state, release, outreach or Phase 23 is authorized.

**Build-time security scanning for MCP servers.**

PortunusMCP Sentinel scans local MCP server source before deployment. It combines
deterministic Python and TypeScript analysis, GPT-5.6 semantic review, optional
Docker-isolated runtime probes, OWASP Agentic Top 10 mappings, and validated
SARIF output for GitHub code scanning.

## Install

Sentinel supports Python 3.10–3.13 on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Install the
current package with [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/):

```bash
pipx install portunusmcp-sentinel
```

Or use uv:

```bash
uv tool install portunusmcp-sentinel
```

Rules-only commands below require **1.3.0 or newer**. Upgrade an existing install
with `pipx upgrade portunusmcp-sentinel` or `uv tool upgrade portunusmcp-sentinel`.

Reports expose observed handlers and recognition gaps, actual rule visits,
per-session runtime catalogs and sent attacks, and separate static/dynamic review
activity. Default findings include bounded evidence and repair guidance. Static
surface totals remain unknown; zero findings are not proof of safety. See the
[coverage and schema compatibility guide](docs/sarif.md#coverage-and-review-activity-native-160).
Phase 22 adds bounded imported handlers/schemas and containment flows;
computed registrations and unresolved source forms remain coverage gaps.
Permission sidecars express intended grants; they do not enforce runtime
boundaries. The Phase 22 integration source schedules bounded rounds across discovered
tools and supported fields (24 started attempts or 120 seconds by default).
Native 1.7.0 and campaign verification remain in progress; published releases
and historical evidence retain their recorded versions.

## Quickstart

From a local Python or TypeScript MCP server repository:

```bash
sentinel scan . --rules-only
```

Rules-only needs no model credentials, review cache, network, Docker, target
configuration, or target execution. It ignores inactive LLM settings even when
credentials and endpoint overrides are present. Installation and dependency
auditing need network access separately.

The Phase 22 integration source allows deterministic static analysis up to 300
seconds, with a 120-second performance target. Fast scans return immediately;
expiry remains an incomplete scan. Model review and dynamic budgets are separate.
See the [timing policy](docs/phase22-timeout-policy.md) for measurement limits and
the retained failures; this change is not yet a published release.

Optionally run `sentinel init` afterward to generate a deny-by-default
`sentinel.permissions.yaml`; review scopes before granting them. It never imports
or executes source and needs no main guard or launch inference. Existing files
require `--force` for replacement; symlinks are rejected.

For Python runtime scaffolding, run `sentinel init --dynamic`, then
`sentinel scan . --no-rules-only`. Adding missing runtime configuration preserves
and validates an existing permissions file. Dynamic scans require Docker,
model credentials, source-context transmission, and model cost; dependency
installation also needs network access. TypeScript does not support `--dynamic`.
If generated arguments cannot complete a legitimate tool call, add known valid
[`probe_baselines`](docs/configuration.md#dynamic-outcomes-and-valid-examples) to
`sentinel.target.yaml`; an unsuccessful baseline leaves analysis incomplete.

Exit `0` and exit `1` both mean the scan completed: `0` means no finding reached
the configured threshold, while `1` means at least one did. Exit `2` is a target
or configuration error; exit `3` means analysis was incomplete.

## Analysis tiers

| Tier | Command | Requirements | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rules-only | `sentinel scan . --rules-only` | None beyond Sentinel | Deterministic findings remain `needs_review` and fail-on eligible |
| Static + GPT review | `sentinel scan . --static-only` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | GPT reviews every selected deterministic candidate |
| Full dynamic proof | `sentinel scan .` | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, Docker, and a Python target | GPT review plus four isolated runtime probes |

`--allow-degraded` permits unavailable review; it still calls the model when a
key is available. Use `--rules-only` to disable review explicitly. Completion
describes the selected analysis tier and does not prove a server is secure.

TypeScript support is static-only and covers `.ts`, `.mts`, and `.cts` sources
using the official MCP SDK v1 and server v2 shapes. JavaScript, TSX, declaration
files and Node execution are outside the supported boundary. Declared uv, npm
and pnpm workspaces support aggregate static scans with root Sentinel settings.
Bounded local imports, package exports and TypeScript source aliases feed
containment and handler inventory. Other rules retain their documented flow
limits. Dynamic targets are individual local Python 3.10–3.12 MCP packages.

Version 1.3.0 includes Phase 16 static-correctness changes: same-file
named-helper execution flows and value-specific validation, authentication,
integrity, and configured-sanitizer checks. Unsupported flows remain unresolved;
see the [rule boundaries](docs/rules.md) and
[verification record](docs/phase16-verification.md).

Phase 17 source changes add validated dynamic baselines, explicit probe outcomes,
and proof-preserving review in native JSON 1.6.0. The current replay bundle uses
one approved runtime-review refresh and four unchanged static captures. See the
[Phase 17 verification record](docs/phase17-verification.md) for gates and acceptance status.

This integration source emits native JSON 1.7.0 with ordered runtime attempts
and workspace coverage. Final Phase 22 verification and acceptance remain open;
historical reports and release evidence retain their recorded schema versions.

## Rules

Every finding uses a stable rule ID and maps to the OWASP Agentic Top 10.

| Rule | Detection | OWASP | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| [SENT-001](docs/rules.md#sent-001) | Overly broad tool permission scope | ASI03:2026 | High |

| [SENT-016](docs/rules.md#sent-016) | Unauthorized operator-credential fallback | ASI03:2026 | High |

Published IDs are compatibility contracts: an ID is never renumbered or reused
for a different detection. The [rule catalog](docs/rules.md) documents each
engine, boundary, false-positive risk, evidence, and remediation.

## GitHub Action

The Marketplace Action runs the full Python pipeline, validates SARIF before
upload, and preserves Sentinel's exit contract.

```yaml
name: PortunusMCP Sentinel

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write

jobs:
  sentinel:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - id: sentinel
        uses: BashaarJavaid/MCP-Sentinel@v1
        with:
          target-path: .
          fail-on: high
          openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

The Action exposes `sarif-path`, `findings-count`, and `highest-severity`.
Forked pull requests, where secrets are withheld, run visibly degraded analysis
and skip upload. High-assurance consumers can replace `@v1` with the immutable
commit SHA for the selected release.

## Architecture

```mermaid

```

Static analysis never imports or executes target code. GPT receives bounded,
redacted context and can only review existing candidates or order four permanent
inert probes. Dynamic analysis mounts local Python source read-only in fresh
containers with no runtime network, resource limits, and forced cleanup. All
stages feed one canonical Finding model consumed by console, JSON, and SARIF.

PortunusMCP Sentinel is the build-time plane of the PortunusMCP family. The
[PortunusMCP Gateway](https://github.com/BashaarJavaid/PortunusMCP) provides
runtime enforcement in a separate repository, while PortunusMCP Identity is the
separate short-lived credential-broker plane. Neither is required by Sentinel.

## Configuration and adoption

Configuration precedence is CLI → `SENTINEL_*` environment → target-root
`sentinel.toml` → built-in defaults. A normal full scan also requires
`sentinel.target.yaml` and `sentinel.permissions.yaml`; `--static-only` does not
require launch configuration.

Create a baseline from a complete native JSON report, then compare later scans:

```bash
sentinel scan . --allow-degraded --format json --output sentinel-baseline.json
sentinel scan . --allow-degraded --baseline sentinel-baseline.json
```

Matched findings remain visible but do not affect `--fail-on`. Sentinel never
updates a baseline automatically.

Suppress a reviewed static source finding with a reason-bearing directive:

```python
# sentinel: ignore[SENT-005] reason=test credential is inert and rotated
api_key = "ghp_example"
```

Only static `SENT-001`–`SENT-007` and `SENT-012`–`SENT-016` findings can be suppressed. Applied
suppressions remain visible in every report; malformed, duplicate, unknown-rule,
or reasonless directives fail configuration validation.

Use Sentinel from pre-commit:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/BashaarJavaid/MCP-Sentinel
    rev: v1.3.0
    hooks:
      - id: mcp-sentinel
```

See the [configuration guide](https://bashaarjavaid.github.io/MCP-Sentinel/configuration/)
for LLM endpoint trust, rule selection, baselines, suppressions, and pre-commit.

## CLI and report reference

```bash
# Full static, GPT, and Docker analysis
sentinel scan ./path/to/server

# Static analysis with required GPT review
sentinel scan ./path/to/server --static-only

# Validated SARIF
sentinel scan ./path/to/server --format sarif --output results.sarif

# Select rules and change the failure threshold
sentinel scan ./path/to/server --rules SENT-001,SENT-005 --fail-on critical

# Exercise the packaged reference pipeline
sentinel demo --replay-review --verbose
```

`--fail-on` accepts `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, or `informational`.
Console output is the default; `--format json` and `--format sarif` are stable
machine-readable paths. Validate reports offline with:

```bash
python -m sentinel.schema check
python -m sentinel.report.validate_sarif results.sarif
```

The production reviewer uses GPT-5.6 Sol through the Responses API with
`store: false`, medium reasoning effort, strict Structured Outputs, bounded
context, and host-validated evidence. Sentinel's public OpenAI cost calculation
uses the rates recorded on 2026-09-04: $4/M input, $0.40/M cached input, and
$20/M output, with cache writes at 1.25× input. See the official
[GPT-5.6 Sol model and pricing page](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.6-sol)
and [Responses API create reference](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/cli/resources/responses/methods/create).
Compatible endpoints retain token usage but report pricing as unavailable.
